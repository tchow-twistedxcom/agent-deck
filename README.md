## The Problem

Running Claude Code on 10 projects? OpenCode on 5 more? Another agent somewhere in the background?

**Managing multiple AI sessions gets messy fast.** Too many terminal tabs. Hard to track what's running, what's waiting, what's done. Switching between projects means hunting through windows.

## The Solution

**Agent Deck is mission control for your AI coding agents.**

One terminal. All your agents. Complete visibility.

- 🎯 **See everything at a glance** - Running, waiting, or idle - know the status of every agent instantly
- ⚡ **Switch in milliseconds** - Jump between any session with a single keystroke
- 🔍 **Never lose track** - Search across all conversations, filter by status, find anything in seconds
- 🌳 **Stay organized** - Group sessions by project, client, or experiment with collapsible hierarchies
- 🔌 **Zero config switching** - Built on tmux - sessions persist through disconnects and reboots

## Features

### 🍴 Explore Multiple Solutions in Parallel

**Try different approaches without losing context.** Fork any Claude conversation instantly. Each fork inherits the full conversation history - perfect for comparing solutions or experimenting without risk.

![Fork Session Demo](demos/fork-session.gif)

- Press `f` for quick fork, `F` to customize name/group
- Fork your forks - explore as many branches as you need
- Session IDs auto-detected even after restarts

**Why this matters:** Ever wished you could try two different approaches to the same problem? Now you can. Fork, experiment, compare results, keep what works.

### 🔌 Add Superpowers On-Demand

**Attach MCP servers without touching config files.** Need web search? Browser automation? GitHub integration? Toggle them on per project or globally - Agent Deck handles the restart automatically.

https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6a4af5ba-bacb-4234-ac72-a019d424d593

- Press `M` to open, `Space` to toggle any MCP server
- **LOCAL** scope (just this project) or **GLOBAL** (everywhere)
- Session auto-restarts with new capabilities loaded

**Why this matters:** Stop editing TOML files. Stop remembering restart commands. Just toggle what you need - Agent Deck takes care of the rest.

**Adding Available MCPs:**

Define your MCPs once in `~/.agent-deck/config.toml`, then toggle them per project:

```toml
# Web search
[mcps.exa]
command = "npx"
args = ["-y", "exa-mcp-server"]
env = { EXA_API_KEY = "your-api-key" }
description = "Web search via Exa AI"

### 🧠 MCP Socket Pool (Heavy Users)

**Running 20+ Claude sessions? Each one spawns separate MCP processes.** That's a lot of memory - 30 sessions with 5 MCPs each = 150 node processes eating gigabytes of RAM.

**MCP Socket Pool shares MCP processes across all sessions via Unix sockets.** One memory server. One exa server. One firecrawl server. All sessions share them.

```
Without pool:              With pool:
Session 1 → memory         Session 1 ─┐
Session 2 → memory         Session 2 ─┼─→ memory (shared)
Session 3 → memory         Session 3 ─┘
= 3 processes              = 1 process

Memory savings: 85-90% for MCP processes
```

**Platform Support:**

| Platform | Socket Pool | Notes |
|----------|-------------|-------|
| macOS | ✅ Full support | Works out of the box |
| Linux | ✅ Full support | Works out of the box |
| WSL2 | ✅ Full support | Works out of the box |
| WSL1 | ❌ Auto-disabled | Uses stdio mode (MCPs still work fine) |
| Windows | ❌ Not supported | Use WSL instead |

> **WSL1 users:** MCP pooling is automatically disabled because Unix sockets don't work reliably. MCPs still work perfectly in stdio mode - you just use more memory with many sessions. Upgrade to WSL2 for socket pooling: `wsl --set-version <distro> 2`

**Enable in `~/.agent-deck/config.toml`:**

```toml
[mcp_pool]
enabled = true     # Enable socket pooling
pool_all = true    # Pool all available MCPs

# Optional: exclude specific MCPs from pool
exclude_mcps = ["chrome-devtools"]
```

When enabled, all MCPs defined in `[mcps.*]` start as socket proxies at launch. Sessions connect via Unix sockets instead of spawning separate processes.

**Indicators:**
- 🔌 in MCP Manager shows pooled MCPs
- Sessions auto-use socket configs on restart

**Why this matters:** If you're a power user running many Claude sessions, this dramatically reduces memory usage. Your laptop stops struggling. Swap stops thrashing. Everything runs smoother.

### 🔍 Find Anything in Seconds

**Fuzzy search across all sessions.** Type a few letters, instantly filter. Need to find that bug fix conversation from last week? The session where you were experimenting with authentication? Just start typing.

Press `/` to search. Filter by status with `!` (running), `@` (waiting), `#` (idle), `$` (error).

**Why this matters:** When you're managing 20+ sessions across different projects, memory fails. Search doesn't.

### 🎯 Know What's Happening, Instantly

**Smart status detection shows you what every agent is doing right now.** No more guessing which session is waiting for input, which is thinking, which finished an hour ago.

| Status | Symbol | What It Means |
|--------|--------|---------------|
| **Running** | `●` green | Agent is actively working |
| **Waiting** | `◐` yellow | Needs your input |
| **Idle** | `○` gray | Ready for commands |
| **Error** | `✕` red | Something went wrong |

Works with Claude Code, Gemini CLI, OpenCode, Codex, Cursor, and any terminal tool.

**Why this matters:** Stop checking every session manually. See the full picture at a glance. Respond when needed. Stay in flow.

### ⚡ Never Miss a Waiting Agent

**Notification bar shows waiting sessions right in your tmux status bar.** Working in one session while another needs input? You'll see it instantly. Press `Ctrl+b 1` to jump there.

```
⚡ [1] frontend [2] api [3] backend
```

- Newest waiting session gets key `1`, second-newest gets `2`, etc.
- Quick-switch with `Ctrl+b 1-6` directly from any tmux session
- Session disappears from bar when you switch to it

**Enable in `~/.agent-deck/config.toml`:**

```toml
[notifications]
enabled = true   # Show waiting sessions in status bar
max_shown = 6    # Max sessions to show (default: 6)
```

**Why this matters:** Running multiple agents in parallel? Now you'll never lose track of which ones need your attention.

## Installation

**Works on:** macOS • Linux • Windows (WSL)

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/asheshgoplani/agent-deck/main/install.sh | bash
```

The installer downloads the binary, installs tmux if needed, and configures tmux for mouse/clipboard support.

Then run: `agent-deck`

agent-deck session stop <id>            # Stop/kill session process
agent-deck session restart <id>         # Restart (Claude: reloads MCPs)

# Fork (Claude only)
agent-deck session fork <id>            # Fork with inherited context
agent-deck session fork <id> -t "exploration"       # Custom title
agent-deck session fork <id> -g "experiments"       # Into specific group

# Attach/Show
agent-deck session attach <id>          # Attach interactively
agent-deck session show <id>            # Show session details
agent-deck session show                 # Auto-detect current session (in tmux)
agent-deck session current              # Auto-detect current session and profile
agent-deck session current -q           # Just session name (for scripting)
agent-deck session current --json       # JSON output (for automation)
```

**Fork flags:**
| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `-t, --title` | Custom title for forked session |
| `-g, --group` | Target group for forked session |

### MCP Commands

Manage Model Context Protocol servers for Claude sessions.

```bash
# List available MCPs (from config.toml)
agent-deck mcp list
agent-deck mcp list --json

# Show attached MCPs for a session
agent-deck mcp attached <id>
agent-deck mcp attached                 # Auto-detect current session

# Attach/Detach MCPs
agent-deck mcp attach <id> github       # Attach to LOCAL scope
agent-deck mcp attach <id> exa --global # Attach to GLOBAL scope
agent-deck mcp attach <id> memory --restart  # Attach and restart session

agent-deck mcp detach <id> github       # Detach from LOCAL

```

**MCP flags:**
| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `--global` | Apply to global Claude config (all projects) |
| `--restart` | Restart session after change (loads new MCPs) |

### Group Commands

Organize sessions into hierarchical groups.

```bash
# List groups
agent-deck group list
agent-deck group list --json

# Create groups
agent-deck group create work            # Create root group
agent-deck group create frontend --parent work  # Create subgroup

# Delete groups
agent-deck group delete old-projects    # Delete (fails if has sessions)
agent-deck group delete old-projects --force    # Move sessions to default, then delete

# Move sessions
agent-deck group move my-session work   # Move session to group
```

**Group flags:**
| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `--parent` | Parent group for creating subgroups |
| `--force` | Force delete by moving sessions to default group |

### Quick Experiments

```bash
agent-deck try <name>              # Create/find dated folder + start session
agent-deck try --list              # List all experiments
agent-deck try --list <query>      # Fuzzy search experiments
agent-deck try <name> -c gemini    # Use different AI tool
agent-deck try <name> --no-session # Create folder only
```

**Config** (`~/.agent-deck/config.toml`):
```toml
[experiments]
directory = "~/src/tries"
date_prefix = true
default_tool = "claude"
```

### Status Command

Quick status check without launching the TUI.

```bash
agent-deck status                       # Compact: "2 waiting - 5 running - 3 idle"
agent-deck status -v                    # Verbose: detailed list by status
agent-deck status -q                    # Quiet: just waiting count (for prompts)
agent-deck status --json                # JSON output
```

### Global Flags

These flags work with all commands:

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `--json` | Output as JSON (for automation) |
| `-q, --quiet` | Minimal output, rely on exit codes |
| `-p, --profile <name>` | Use specific profile |

### Examples

**Scripting with JSON output:**
```bash
# Get all running sessions
agent-deck list --json | jq '.[] | select(.status == "running")'

# Count waiting sessions
agent-deck status -q  # Returns just the number

# Check if specific session exists
agent-deck session show my-project --json 2>/dev/null && echo "exists"
```

**Automation workflows:**
```bash
# Start all sessions in a group
agent-deck list --json | jq -r '.[] | select(.group == "work") | .id' | \
  xargs -I{} agent-deck session start {}

# Attach MCP to all Claude sessions
agent-deck list --json | jq -r '.[] | select(.tool == "claude") | .id' | \
  xargs -I{} agent-deck mcp attach {} memory --restart
```

**Current session detection (inside tmux):**
```bash
# Auto-detect current session and profile (NEW!)
agent-deck session current              # Full info with auto-detected profile
agent-deck session current -q           # Just session name (for scripting)
agent-deck session current --json       # JSON output (for automation)

# Show current session info (legacy, still works)
agent-deck session show

# Show MCPs for current session
agent-deck mcp attached

# Use in workflows (auto-detect parent and profile)
PARENT=$(agent-deck session current -q)
PROFILE=$(agent-deck session current --json | jq -r '.profile')
agent-deck -p "$PROFILE" add -t "Subtask" --parent "$PARENT" -c claude /tmp/subtask
```

## Updates

Agent-deck checks for updates automatically and notifies you when a new version is available.

### Update Notification

When you open the TUI, a yellow banner appears if an update is available:
```
⬆ Update available: v0.8.1 → v0.8.2 (run: agent-deck update)
```

CLI commands (`list`, `status`) also show a notification:
```
💡 Update available: v0.8.1 → v0.8.2 (run: agent-deck update)
```

### Update Commands

```bash
agent-deck update              # Check and install update
agent-deck update --check      # Just check, don't install
agent-deck update --force      # Force check (bypass 24h cache)
```

### Configuration

Add to `~/.agent-deck/config.toml`:

```toml
[updates]
# Automatically install updates without prompting (default: false)
auto_update = true

# Enable update checks on startup (default: true)
check_enabled = true

# How often to check for updates in hours (default: 24)
check_interval_hours = 24

# Show update notification in CLI commands (default: true)
notify_in_cli = true
```

### Auto-Update

When `auto_update = true`, agent-deck will:
1. Check for updates on startup
2. Automatically download and install if available
3. Exit so you can restart with the new version

## FAQ

### How is this different from just using tmux?

Agent Deck adds **AI-specific intelligence** on top of tmux:
- **Smart status detection** - Knows when Claude is thinking vs. waiting for input (not just "session exists")
- **Session forking** - Duplicate Claude conversations with full context inheritance
- **MCP manager** - Visual interface for attaching/detaching Model Context Protocol servers
- **Global search** - Find conversations across all sessions instantly
- **Organized groups** - Hierarchical project organization instead of flat session lists

Think of it as **tmux + AI awareness**. The sessions run in tmux (reliability), but Agent Deck adds the layer that understands what AI agents are doing.

### Does it work with tools besides Claude Code?

**Yes!** Agent Deck works with any terminal-based tool:
- ✅ **Claude Code** - Full integration (session detection, MCP management, fork, resume)
- ✅ **Gemini CLI** - Full integration (session detection, MCP management, resume)
  - Session detection from `~/.gemini/tmp/<project-hash>/chats/`
  - Resume with `gemini --resume <id>`
  - MCP management via UI (press `M`)
  - Response extraction via `session output`
  - **Note:** No fork support (use sub-sessions instead)
- ✅ OpenCode
- ✅ Cursor (terminal mode)
- ✅ Codex
- ✅ Custom shell scripts
- ✅ Any command-line tool

Claude and Gemini get full integration with session management, MCP configuration, and response extraction. Other tools get status detection, organization, and search.

### Can I use it on Windows?

**Yes, via WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux).**

1. [Install WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) (Ubuntu recommended)
2. Open WSL terminal
3. Run the installer: `curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/asheshgoplani/agent-deck/main/install.sh | bash`

Agent Deck runs inside WSL and works exactly like it does on macOS/Linux.

**WSL Version Differences:**

| Feature | WSL1 | WSL2 |
|---------|------|------|
| Core functionality | ✅ | ✅ |
| MCP management | ✅ | ✅ |
| Session forking | ✅ | ✅ |
| MCP socket pooling | ❌ Auto-disabled | ✅ |
| Clipboard (via clip.exe) | ✅ | ✅ |

**WSL2 is recommended** for the best experience. Check your version with `wsl --list --verbose`. Upgrade with `wsl --set-version <distro> 2`.

On WSL1, MCP socket pooling is automatically disabled (Unix sockets don't work reliably), but everything else works fine. MCPs run in stdio mode instead.

### Will it interfere with my existing tmux setup?

**No.** Agent Deck creates its own tmux sessions with the prefix `agentdeck_*`. Your existing sessions are untouched.

The installer adds optional tmux config (mouse support, clipboard integration) but:
- It backs up your existing `~/.tmux.conf` first
- You can skip it with `--skip-tmux-config` flag
- It only adds to your config, never removes

### How do I add more MCP servers?

Edit `~/.agent-deck/config.toml` and add your servers:

**Stdio MCPs** (local command-line tools):
```toml
[mcps.your-server]
command = "npx"
args = ["-y", "your-mcp-package"]
env = { API_KEY = "your-key" }
description = "What this server does"
```

**HTTP/SSE MCPs** (remote servers):
```toml
[mcps.remote-api]
url = "https://mcp.example.com/mcp"
transport = "http"  # or "sse"
description = "Remote MCP server"
```

Then press `M` in Agent Deck to toggle it on/off for any session. [See MCP examples](#adding-available-mcps).

### Why is Agent Deck using so much memory?

If you're running many Claude sessions (10+), each spawns its own MCP processes. This adds up fast.

**Enable MCP Socket Pool** to share processes across sessions (macOS, Linux, WSL2 only):

```toml
# ~/.agent-deck/config.toml
[mcp_pool]
enabled = true
pool_all = true
```

Restart Agent Deck. All sessions now share MCP processes via Unix sockets. Memory usage drops 85-90% for MCP-related processes.

> **Note:** On WSL1 and Windows, socket pooling is automatically disabled. MCPs work in stdio mode instead, which uses more memory but is fully functional.

### What if a session crashes?

tmux sessions persist even if Agent Deck closes. If a session crashes:

1. **Check logs**: `~/.agent-deck/logs/agentdeck_<session-name>_<id>.log`
2. **Restart it**: `agent-deck session restart <session-id>`
3. **Or delete and recreate**: `agent-deck remove <id>` then `agent-deck add <path>`

Sessions are stored in `~/.agent-deck/profiles/default/sessions.json` with automatic backups (`.bak`, `.bak.1`, `.bak.2`).

## Documentation

### Project Organization

```

**Set defaults for new sessions** in `~/.agent-deck/config.toml`:

```toml
# Pre-select Claude when creating new sessions (instead of shell)
default_tool = "claude"

# Claude-specific settings
[claude]
# Custom profile directory (for dual account setups)
config_dir = "~/.claude-work"
# Enable --dangerously-skip-permissions by default
dangerous_mode = true

# Gemini-specific settings
[gemini]
# Enable --yolo (auto-approve all) by default
yolo_mode = true
```

**Available `default_tool` values:** `"claude"`, `"gemini"`, `"opencode"`, `"codex"`, or any custom tool name from `[tools.*]`.

### tmux Configuration

The installer configures tmux automatically. For manual setup, see the [tmux configuration guide](https://github.com/asheshgoplani/agent-deck/wiki/tmux-Configuration).

## Troubleshooting

### Mouse Scrolling Not Working (WSL)

If scrolling doesn't work or you can't scroll back through output on WSL:

**Quick Fix: Re-run the installer**
```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/asheshgoplani/agent-deck/main/install.sh | bash
```

The installer will detect outdated tmux config and offer to update it with the WSL-compatible version.

**Manual Fix:**

1. Remove old agent-deck config from `~/.tmux.conf`:
   ```bash
   sed -i '/# agent-deck configuration/,/# End agent-deck configuration/d' ~/.tmux.conf
   ```

2. Add the updated config:
   ```bash
   cat >> ~/.tmux.conf << 'EOF'
   # agent-deck configuration
   # agent-deck-tmux-config-version: 2

   set -g default-terminal "tmux-256color"
   set -ag terminal-overrides ",xterm*:Tc:smcup@:rmcup@"
   set -ag terminal-overrides ",*256col*:Tc"
   set -sg escape-time 0
   set -g history-limit 50000
   set -g mouse on

   # Auto-enter copy-mode on scroll up (critical for WSL)
   bind-key -n WheelUpPane if-shell -F -t = "#{mouse_any_flag}" "send-keys -M" "if -Ft= '#{pane_in_mode}' 'send-keys -M' 'copy-mode -e'"

   # Scroll bindings in copy-mode
   bind-key -T copy-mode-vi WheelUpPane send-keys -X scroll-up
   bind-key -T copy-mode-vi WheelDownPane send-keys -X scroll-down
   bind-key -T copy-mode WheelUpPane send-keys -X scroll-up
   bind-key -T copy-mode WheelDownPane send-keys -X scroll-down

   # Clipboard (WSL uses clip.exe)
   bind-key -T copy-mode-vi MouseDragEnd1Pane send-keys -X copy-pipe-and-cancel "clip.exe"
   bind-key -T copy-mode MouseDragEnd1Pane send-keys -X copy-pipe-and-cancel "clip.exe"
   # End agent-deck configuration
   EOF
   ```

3. Reload tmux:
   ```bash
   tmux source-file ~/.tmux.conf
   ```

**Why this happens:** The original config only had `set -g mouse on`, which works on macOS but not reliably on all WSL terminal emulators. The fix adds explicit `WheelUpPane` bindings that enter copy-mode when scrolling up.

### Clipboard Not Working (WSL)

If copying to clipboard doesn't work in WSL:

1. **Verify clip.exe is accessible:**
   ```bash
   echo "test" | clip.exe && powershell.exe Get-Clipboard
   # Should output: test
   ```

2. **If clip.exe not found**, ensure Windows system32 is in PATH:
   ```bash
   export PATH="$PATH:/mnt/c/Windows/System32"
   ```

### tmux History Too Short

If you can't scroll back far enough:

1. The default is now 50,000 lines. To increase:
   ```bash
   # In ~/.tmux.conf
   set -g history-limit 100000
   ```

2. Reload: `tmux source-file ~/.tmux.conf`

**Note:** Higher limits use more memory per pane.

### Sessions Lost After Reboot

tmux sessions don't persist through system reboots. However, agent-deck preserves your session **metadata** (titles, groups, paths).

After reboot:
1. Your sessions will show as "error" status (tmux process gone)
2. Press `r` on any session to restart it
3. Claude/Gemini sessions will resume from last conversation if session ID was captured

To preserve conversation context across reboots, ensure sessions have captured session IDs (shown in session details with `agent-deck session show`).
