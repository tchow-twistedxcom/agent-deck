// must route through (issue #1777).
//
// The invariant it enforces: agent-deck must never cause text it did not
// receive from the operator to be submitted. A Claude autosuggestion can
// materialize in the composer as REAL, normal-coloured (`\e[39m`) unsubmitted
// input — indistinguishable from an operator draft by colour alone — and the
// send-verify loops' fallback "nudge Enter" presses would submit it as an
// instruction nobody authored. So the rule is inverted from "block what looks
// like a ghost" to "press only what is positively attributable": an empty
// composer, a suggestion/placeholder, the message agent-deck itself just
// typed, or that message collapsed behind Claude's paste marker with
// provenance evidence (OwnPasteMarker) that the collapse is ours.
//
// Failure semantics are deliberately asymmetric: withholding a nudge only
// leaves a delivery unconfirmed (the verify then classifies it — #1413
// semantics — recoverable), while a wrong press submits foreign text
// (unrecoverable). Every field therefore fails safe at its zero value.

	// cannot be matched against Message by content and provenance is the only
	// available evidence. Callers set it true only when they positively
	// observed, immediately before typing, a composer holding no paste marker
	// (see ComposerHoldsPasteMarker): a marker seen afterwards can then only
