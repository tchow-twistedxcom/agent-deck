// SpawnFailureRecord captures why a session's initial process died at or shortly
// after spawn. Issue #1580: when a custom command (e.g. a broken
// `codex.command` npx wrapper) exits immediately, tmux tears the whole session
// down and takes the pane output with it. Status detection later only sees
// "tmux session missing" → StatusError, so the TUI shows a bare "error" with no
// preview and nothing in the logs. This record is written to disk as a durable
// sidecar the moment the death is observed, so the failure survives the process
// boundary and can be surfaced in the preview pane, `session show`, and the
// lifecycle log.

// same name), it persists a SpawnFailureRecord with the last captured output +
// elapsed time and emits a spawn_died_fast lifecycle event. A survivor emits a
// spawn_survived event and writes nothing.
//
// Best-effort and self-contained: all errors are swallowed so the watcher can
// never affect the spawn path. Runs in its own goroutine.
// The watcher runs in its own goroutine, so it must never read i's
// mutex-guarded mutable fields directly. Everything it needs is passed by
// value: the pane session pointer captured at launch (sess), the instance id
// and tool, and gen — a snapshot of i.spawnGen taken at launch. A deliberate
// stop or a restart/respawn bumps i.spawnGen, so a mismatch means this watcher
// has been superseded and must exit quietly (#1580 data-race fix).
//
// wake is the supersede channel, subscribed by the caller via
// newSpawnGenWatch() before this goroutine starts (see instance.go). Closing
// it lets a supersession be noticed immediately rather than only on the next
// spawnFastDeathTick poll — see spawnGenWake's doc comment for why the
// up-to-one-tick tail mattered.
//
// The generation is re-checked immediately before each write, not just once
// per iteration: sess.Exists() shells out to tmux and can take tens of
// milliseconds, and a Stop/Kill landing inside that call would otherwise be
// observed as a vanished session — i.e. recorded as a spurious
// spawn_died_fast for what was a deliberate teardown (and written into a HOME
// the owning test may already be tearing down).
//
// Every write additionally goes through commitSpawnWatchWrite, which re-checks
// the generation while holding spawnWriteMu. That is what turns the remaining
// check-then-write gap from small into closed: a teardown that bumps and then
// takes the same mutex (bumpSpawnGenAndBarrier) is guaranteed that any write
// still pending here either completed before it, or sees the new generation and
// is suppressed. Only the writes are covered, never the tmux calls, so a stop
// never waits on tmux.
//
// lifecycleLogPath and failureDir are likewise passed by value rather than
// resolved here from the live $HOME: this goroutine is never joined, so it
// can still be alive (parked on the ticker) after its caller's test has
// finished and a later test has repointed $HOME. Resolving live at write
// time would make the watcher write into whatever $HOME happens to be
// current when it fires, not the one that was current when it was spawned.
