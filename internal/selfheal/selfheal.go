// Package selfheal is the deterministic "Go floor" of the self-heal supervision
// design (SELF-HEAL-DESIGN.md §4.3). It detects a TRULY stuck session, classifies
// the cause, and — gated by a release stage — decides on a bounded, idempotent,
// fully-logged recovery.
//
// STAGE 1 (this release, v1.9.67) is OBSERVE-ONLY. The engine evaluates the §1.3
// stuck predicate, exercises the caps / backoff / circuit-breaker / flicker
// state-machine, and LOGS what it WOULD do — but takes ZERO action. Observe mode
// holds no action executor at all, so "no recovery primitive is ever called" is a
// structural property, not a runtime check (see Engine.Observe and the
// no-action test). Modes single_action / full are DEFINED but GUARDED: they
// refuse to act until Stages 2-3 are re-approved (the three §9 gap-fixes).
//
// The module is pure: it consumes a Candidate snapshot (already-read data) and a
// monotonic clock, and emits a structured Event to an EventSink. It never reaches
// into tmux, never calls SaveInstances, never touches the rebind path. That
// keeps the predicate and the safety machine fully unit-testable and guarantees
// the observe-only invariant.
