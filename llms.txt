# Agent Deck

> Terminal session manager for AI coding agents

Agent Deck is a TUI (Terminal User Interface) that manages multiple AI coding agent sessions from a single dashboard. Built with Go and Bubble Tea, it runs on top of tmux.

## Key Features

- **Multi-agent dashboard**: See status (running/waiting/idle/error) of all sessions at a glance
- **Session forking**: Fork Claude Code conversations to explore different approaches in parallel
- **MCP Manager**: Toggle MCP servers per session without editing config files
- **MCP Socket Pool**: Share MCP processes across sessions, reducing memory by 85-90%
- **Global search**: Search across all Claude conversations with fuzzy and regex matching
- **Git worktrees**: Isolate agent work on separate branches automatically
- **Multi-tool support**: Claude Code, Gemini CLI, Aider, Codex, OpenCode, and any terminal tool
