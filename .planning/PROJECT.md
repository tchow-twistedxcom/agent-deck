# Agent Deck

## What This Is

Terminal session manager for AI coding agents. Go + Bubble Tea TUI that manages tmux sessions for Claude Code, Gemini CLI, Codex, OpenCode, and other AI tools. Ships as a single static binary with CLI, TUI, and an embedded web server (Preact SPA + WebSocket terminal bridge) for remote access over localhost, LAN, or Tailscale.

## Core Value

Reliable session management for AI coding agents: users can create, monitor, and control many concurrent agent sessions from anywhere (desktop terminal, mobile browser, web) without losing work or context.

## Current Milestone: v1.5.4 — Per-group Claude Config

**Starting point:** v1.5.3 (commit `ee7f29e` on `fix/feedback-closeout`). v1.5.3 completed feedback closeout and added a repo-root `CLAUDE.md` mandate forbidding `--no-verify` — carried forward to this milestone.

**Worktree isolation:** v1.5.4 runs on branch `fix/per-group-claude-config-v154` (forked from upstream PR #578 HEAD `fa9971e` by @alec-pinson). Main's `.planning/` tracks v1.6.0 (Watcher Framework). Phase numbering here restarts at `1`; phase dirs `13-`, `14-`, `15-` in `.planning/phases/` are v1.6.0 artifacts, left untouched.

**Goal:** Accept external PR #578 (`feat/per-group-config` by @alec-pinson) as the base and close the gaps that block adoption for the user's conductor use case — prove per-group `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` injection works for custom-command sessions (conductors), prove `env_file` is sourced before `claude` exec, and ship regression tests + a visual harness so neither semantics regress.

**Source spec:** `docs/PER-GROUP-CLAUDE-CONFIG-SPEC.md` (commit `4ade7f8`).

**Base contribution:** PR #578 by @alec-pinson. At least one commit in this milestone must carry attribution: "Base implementation by @alec-pinson in PR #578."

**Prior milestone (carried over):** v1.6.0 — Watcher Framework

**Source spec:** `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-04-10-watcher-framework-design.md`

**Target features:**
- Generic watcher subsystem with pluggable adapter interface (webhook, ntfy, Gmail, Slack)
- Config-driven routing via `clients.json` with wildcard domain matching
- Watcher engine with event dedup, health tracking, and silence detection
- CLI: `agent-deck watcher create/start/stop/list/status/test/routes`
- TUI watcher panel with status indicators, event rates, and quick actions
- Triage sessions for unknown senders (Claude Code sessions under subscription)
- Self-improving routing: confirmed decisions auto-add to `clients.json`
- Migration path from existing bash issue-watcher scripts
- Watcher-creator skill for conversational watcher setup
- Health alerts via Telegram/Slack/Discord (reusing conductor notification bridge)

### Active (v1.5.4 scope)

v1.5.4 milestone complete — all 11 CFG requirements validated. See validated entries above (CFG-01..CFG-11) and `.planning/REQUIREMENTS.md` for traceability.

### v1.6.0 — Watcher Framework (deferred on this branch)

The v1.6.0 scope is tracked on `main`. It does NOT progress on this branch. Do not touch `.planning/phases/13-*`, `14-*`, `15-*` or `internal/watcher/*` here.

- [x] Watcher subsystem with pluggable adapter interface — Validated in Phase 13: WatcherAdapter interface (Setup/Listen/Teardown/HealthCheck), AdapterConfig, Event struct with DedupKey
- [x] Config-driven routing via `clients.json` with wildcard domain matching — Validated in Phase 13: Router.Match() with exact-over-wildcard priority, LoadClientsJSON, LoadFromWatcherDir
- [x] Watcher engine with event dedup, health tracking, and silence detection — Validated in Phase 13: Engine with single-writer goroutine, eventEnvelope pattern, INSERT OR IGNORE dedup, HealthTracker with rolling rate and silence detection
- [ ] CLI: `agent-deck watcher create/start/stop/list/status/test/routes`
- [ ] TUI watcher panel with status indicators, event rates, and quick actions
- [ ] Triage sessions for unknown senders
- [ ] Self-improving routing: confirmed decisions auto-add to `clients.json`
- [ ] Migration path from existing bash issue-watcher scripts
- [ ] Watcher-creator skill for conversational watcher setup
- [ ] Health alerts via conductor notification bridge

### Out of Scope

- **Managed Agents / Agent SDK** — Both require API key billing, incompatible with subscription-based Claude Code sessions. All intelligence runs via agent-deck session launch.
- **Always-on LLM router** — Config-driven routing handles 95%+ of cases; triage session fallback for unknowns. No persistent LLM process for routing.
- **Web UI for watcher management** — v1.6.0 focuses on TUI + CLI. Web watcher panel deferred to v1.7+.
- **IMAP IDLE adapter** — Requires always-running TCP connection. Gmail Pub/Sub is the recommended path for Google accounts. IMAP deferred.
- **End-user watcher marketplace** — Community adapters are a future possibility but not v1.6.0 scope.
- **Windows native support** — Carried from v1.5.0. Tailscale covers remote access.
- **iOS/Android native apps** — Carried from v1.5.0. PWA via web app remains the mobile path.

## Context

**Brownfield:** Mature codebase at v1.5.0. Architecture is a layered Go monolith: `cmd/agent-deck` → `internal/ui` (Bubble Tea TUI, ~12K lines) + `internal/web` (HTTP/WS/SSE server) + `internal/session` (data model) + `internal/tmux` (tmux abstraction) + `internal/statedb` (SQLite via `modernc.org/sqlite`, no CGO).

**Conductor subsystem (blueprint for watchers):** `internal/session/conductor.go` defines ConductorMeta, `cmd/agent-deck/conductor_cmd.go` handles CLI dispatch (setup/teardown/status/list). Conductors have `~/.agent-deck/conductor/<name>/meta.json`, TUI rendering, and Telegram/Slack/Discord notification bridge. Watchers follow this exact pattern with `~/.agent-deck/watchers/<name>/meta.json`.

**Existing watcher infrastructure (bash, production-validated):** `~/.agent-deck/issue-watcher/` handles GitHub issues and Slack bug reports via Cloudflare Worker → ntfy.sh → bash handler → `agent-deck launch`. Config-driven routing via `channels.json`. Thread-reply routing back to original sessions. v1/v2 payload versioning for ntfy 4KB limit. Per-channel dedup, logging, and user filtering.

**Existing Go watcher patterns:** `internal/session/event_watcher.go` (fsnotify + channel), `internal/ui/storage_watcher.go` (polling + channel), `internal/costs/watcher.go`. All use context cancellation, goroutine lifecycle, and buffered channels.

**Key files to create:**
- New package: `internal/watcher/` (adapter.go, router.go, webhook.go, engine.go, config.go, health.go)
- CLI: `cmd/agent-deck/watcher_cmd.go`
- DB: new tables in `internal/statedb/statedb.go`
- Config: `WatcherSettings` in `internal/session/userconfig.go`
- TUI: watcher panel additions in `internal/ui/home.go`

**Key files to modify:**
- `cmd/agent-deck/main.go` (add `case "watcher"` dispatch)
- `internal/statedb/statedb.go` (add watchers + watcher_events tables)
- `internal/session/userconfig.go` (add WatcherSettings to UserConfig)

**GitHub issues still tracked:** #391 (per-session colors), #434 (Ctrl+Q), #447 (reorg groups) — deferred to v1.7+.

## Constraints

- **Go toolchain**: Pinned to 1.24.0 via `GOTOOLCHAIN=go1.24.0` in `Makefile` and `.goreleaser.yml`. Go 1.25 silently breaks macOS TUI (2026-03-26 incident). Non-negotiable.
- **SQLite schema changes require ALTER TABLE migration**: Every new column in CREATE TABLE MUST also have a corresponding ALTER TABLE in the alterMigrations slice. PR #385 incident: missing migration broke all existing users.
- **Subscription-only intelligence**: No API key billing. All LLM work runs in Claude Code sessions launched via `agent-deck launch` (subscription-based). Watcher layer and router are pure Go (no LLM calls).
- **Batch sizing**: 3-5 PRs per batch with `make ci` + macOS TUI test between each batch. Never merge 15+ PRs at once (the v0.27.0 anti-pattern).
- **Release builds**: Must verify `vcs.modified=false` via `go version -m ./build/agent-deck`. Dirty builds never ship.
- **Visual verification**: Mandatory before every release. `scripts/visual-verify.sh` must pass for all 5 TUI states.
- **Testing philosophy**: Every shipped bug is a missing test. Regression test must be written *before* the fix, and must fail without the fix.
- **Conductor pattern compliance**: Watchers must follow conductor patterns: meta.json filesystem layout, statedb persistence, TUI panel rendering, CLI subcommand dispatch. No divergent infrastructure.

## Key Decisions

| Decision | Rationale | Outcome |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| Keep Preact + HTM + Tailwind + xterm.js stack | v1.4.0 research validated against ttyd, PocketBase, syncthing, code-server | ✓ Locked (carried from v1.4.0) |
| Introduce esbuild JS bundling (PERF-H) | 24 separate ES module fetches on cold load — bundling cuts request count and enables effective caching | — Pending |
| Enable gzip on static files (PERF-A) | Biggest single win — ~518 KB saved on wire per cold load. Simple `gziphandler.GzipHandler` wrap. | — Pending |
| Profile switcher: fix via reload OR remove | Current dropdown lies (clicks do nothing). Runtime profile switch would require re-architecting profile isolation; page reload with `?profile=X` is the pragmatic path. If that's too invasive, remove dropdown and show read-only label. | ✓ Resolved Phase 6 plan 06-01 (Option B — read-only multi-profile listbox, single-profile `role="status"`, always-visible HELP_TEXT). POL-3 (Phase 9 plan 09-02) extended with `_*` filter and `max-h-[300px] overflow-y-auto`. |
| Session title truncation fix via absolute-positioned action buttons | v1.4.0 Phase 3's `min-w-0` propagation did not solve it — 76% still truncated. Root cause is buttons reserving 90px even when hidden. Absolute overlay fixes reservation. | ✓ Resolved Phase 6 plan 06-03 (title span ratio 0.30 → 0.66). |
| Toast auto-dismiss + stack cap | 403 errors when mutations disabled currently spawn infinite undismissable toasts. Auto-dismiss 5s + cap 3 is the pragmatic fix. | ✓ Resolved Phase 6 plan 06-04 (eviction-with-history pattern, visible stack cap 3, error-FIFO, info/success 5s auto-dismiss, errors preserved + ToastHistoryDrawer). POL-7 shipped early with WEB-P0-4. Phase 9 plan 09-03 locked a regression guard. |
| Visual regression in CI with committed baselines | v1.4.0 user testing revealed 4 P0 bugs slipped through manual review. Automated visual diff prevents regression recurrence. | — Pending (Phase 10 TEST-A) |
| Lighthouse CI perf budgets | Premium feel is a binary outcome — either the budgets hold or they don't. CI enforcement prevents slow drift. | — Pending (Phase 10 TEST-B) |
| SessionList virtualization (PERF-K) | 876 DOM nodes before any session is too high. Virtual scrolling via @tanstack/virtual OR hand-rolled is the industry standard answer. | ✓ Resolved Phase 8 plan 08-04 (useVirtualList hook + feature-flagged SessionList integration). |
| esbuild JS bundling (PERF-H) | 24 separate ES module fetches on cold load — bundling cuts request count and enables effective caching. | ✓ Resolved Phase 8 plan 08-05 (esbuild via `go generate` + assets manifest). |
| Light theme WCAG AA audit (POL-6) | Plans 06-03 and 06-04 flagged `text-gray-400` (2.6:1) and translucent backgrounds as "POL-6 territory" — needed a single pass across all surfaces after the final layout landed. | ✓ Resolved Phase 9 plan 09-04 (18 Playwright tests green; 11 axe-core + 7 luminance; `text-gray-400` → `text-gray-600` across 8 components; 17 → 0 violations). |
| Locale-aware currency formatting (POL-5) | `'$' + v.toFixed(2)` ignores user locale; premium apps format per `navigator.language`. | ✓ Resolved Phase 9 plan 09-02 (module-level `Intl.NumberFormat(navigator.language, {style: 'currency', currency: 'USD'})` memoized; both `fmt()` and chart y-axis tick callback delegate to the same instance). |
| Skeleton loader matching final layout (POL-1) | Users see "No sessions" flicker during the cold-load gap before `/api/menu` returns. Linear/Vercel pattern: render a layout-matched skeleton stack. | ✓ Resolved Phase 9 plan 09-01 (new `sessionsLoadedSignal`, tri-state render in SessionList.js, `animate-pulse motion-reduce:animate-none`). |
| auto_advance disabled in GSD config | User explicitly requested each stage in a separate session for context hygiene | ✓ Enforced |
| Pure Go watcher layer (no LLM in routing) | Managed Agents and Agent SDK require API key billing, incompatible with Max subscription. Config-driven routing handles 95%+ of cases at zero cost. | — Pending (v1.6.0) |
| Extend issue-watcher pattern into Go subsystem | Existing bash scripts (handle-issue.sh, handle-slack-channel.sh) prove the architecture works. Go subsystem adds type safety, atomicity, TUI visibility, and health monitoring. | — Pending (v1.6.0) |
| Conductor pattern as blueprint for watchers | Watchers follow conductor's filesystem layout (meta.json), statedb persistence, CLI dispatch, and TUI rendering. 65-70% infrastructure reuse. | — Pending (v1.6.0) |
| v1.5.4: Accept PR #578 by @alec-pinson as base, add gap-closing work additively | PR #578 solves config schema cleanly. The user's conductor case needs custom-command injection + env_file sourcing + regression tests — all additive on top of #578 with attribution. | — Pending (v1.5.4) |
| v1.5.4: Phase numbering restarts at 1 on this worktree | Branch is forked from v1.5.3 (`ee7f29e`), independent of main's v1.6.0 track (phases 13+). Self-contained numbering avoids ambiguity in commit trailers. | ✓ Locked |
