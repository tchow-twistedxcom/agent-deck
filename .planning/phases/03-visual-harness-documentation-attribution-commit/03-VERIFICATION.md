  - must_have: "Harness uses `agent-deck session send` AND `agent-deck session output` call sites"
    reason: "Script uses /proc/<pane_pid>/environ (Linux kernel env snapshot) instead of session-send/output round-trip. Approved at Task 2 checkpoint by Ashesh Goplani with rationale: /proc reads the exact tmux-spawn environment directly — strictly tighter assertion than a session-send round-trip that goes through the agent-ready gate (80s timeout). Deviation recorded in 03-01-SUMMARY.md key-decisions."

human_verification:
  - test: "Review --no-verify usage on planning doc commit 911c0e7"
    expected: "Confirm this is acceptable given no .go files were staged (gofmt/vet would have been a no-op)"
    why_human: "STATE.md hard rule says no --no-verify with no exception carved out for planning docs. 03-02-SUMMARY self-check notes 'committed with git add -f + --no-verify'. The pre-commit hook runs gofmt+vet — since only a .md file was staged the hook would have been a no-op. Whether this technical bypass violates the intent of the mandate (code quality, not doc commits) requires a human judgment call."
  - test: "Review code-review warnings WR-01, WR-02, WR-03 in 03-REVIEW.md"
    expected: "Decide if any warning should be converted to a must-have for this phase or deferred to a future phase"
    why_human: "03-REVIEW.md (0 critical / 3 warning / 6 info) documents: WR-01 (preflight missing awk + bash-4 version check), WR-02 (/proc read is single-shot not polled — race with claude startup), WR-03 (poll_output defined but never called — dead code). The harness passed runtime verification (PASS: 2/2 in artifact log), so these are quality issues not correctness blockers. Human should decide if any warrant a follow-up fix commit."

# Phase 3: Visual Harness + Documentation + Attribution Commit — Verification Report

**Phase Goal:** Ship the human-watchable verification script, update all three doc surfaces (README, CLAUDE.md, CHANGELOG), and record attribution to @alec-pinson in at least one commit.
**Verified:** 2026-04-15T20:40:27Z
**Status:** human_needed
**Re-verification:** No — initial verification

## Goal Achievement

### Observable Truths

| # | Truth | Status | Evidence |
|---|-------|--------|----------|
| 1 | `bash scripts/verify-per-group-claude-config.sh` exits 0 on conductor host | VERIFIED | Artifact log `harness-run-20260415T201810Z.log` ends with `PASS: 2/2`; exit code 0 confirmed in 03-01-SUMMARY |
| 2 | Harness prints pass/fail table with both rows marked and final `PASS: 2/2` line | VERIFIED | Artifact log shows two ✓ rows and `PASS: 2/2` on last line |
| 3 | Harness leaves zero residue: no verify-group-* groups/sessions, config.toml restored | VERIFIED | trap cleanup confirmed in SUMMARY; residue check returned 0/0 |
| 4 | Harness exercises BOTH code paths (normal claude + custom-command session) | VERIFIED | Session A uses `-c claude` (line 190); Session B uses throwaway wrapper script via `-c "$WRAPPER_SCRIPT"` (line 191) |
| 5 | Harness uses `trash` for temp-file cleanup (never `rm`) | VERIFIED | `grep -c 'trash' scripts/verify-per-group-claude-config.sh` = 4; `grep -E '\brm\b'` = 0 hits |
| 6 | Harness commit body carries `Base implementation by @alec-pinson in PR #578.` | VERIFIED | `git log -1 --pretty=%b 16c891d` contains exact string |
| 7 | README.md has exactly one `### Per-group Claude config` subsection with locked TOML, harness pointer, and priority summary | VERIFIED | `grep -c "^### Per-group Claude config$" README.md` = 1; all content present at lines 98-113 |
| 8 | Repo-root CLAUDE.md is tracked and contains `TestPerGroupConfig_*` enforcement one-liner under session-persistence heading | VERIFIED | `git ls-files --error-unmatch CLAUDE.md` exits 0; `grep -c "TestPerGroupConfig_" CLAUDE.md` = 1; verbatim one-liner at line 50 |
| 9 | CHANGELOG `[Unreleased]` block has `### Added` with the bullet referencing `[PR #578]` | VERIFIED | `sed -n '8,13p' CHANGELOG.md` shows correct structure; bullet contains PR #578 link |
| 10 | `git log main..HEAD --grep "@alec-pinson"` returns >= 2 commits | VERIFIED | Returns 16 commits (well over threshold) |
| 11 | No commit on `main..HEAD` (Ashesh-authored) contains `Generated with Claude Code` or `Co-Authored-By: Claude` | VERIFIED | Audit count = 0; upstream a7b9fe4 carries `Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 4.6` (alec-pinson's own tooling, out-of-mandate scope per plan's author-filter) |
| 12 | No `git push`, `git tag`, `gh release`, `gh pr create`, `gh pr merge` executed during this phase | VERIFIED | Reflog scan = 0 forbidden-op hits; hard-rule audit PASS |

**Score:** 12/12 truths verified (1 override applied for key_link deviation on truth 5/artifact wiring)

### Deferred Items

None. All requirements in scope for this phase are fully implemented.

### Required Artifacts

| Artifact | Expected | Status | Details |
|----------|----------|--------|---------|
| `scripts/verify-per-group-claude-config.sh` | CFG-05 visual harness, chmod +x, bash-n clean, 256 lines | VERIFIED | 256 lines, executable, bash -n clean, contains all required patterns |
| `README.md` | `### Per-group Claude config` subsection | VERIFIED | Inserted at lines 98-113, between `### Skills Manager` (L89) and `### MCP Socket Pool` (L114) |
| `CLAUDE.md` | Repo-root file tracked, session-persistence heading, TestPerGroupConfig_ one-liner | VERIFIED | Resurrected via Path A from `a262c6d:CLAUDE.md`; tracked; one-liner at line 50 |
| `CHANGELOG.md` | `[Unreleased] > Added` bullet with PR #578 reference | VERIFIED | Bullet at line 11 between `## [Unreleased]` (L8) and `## [1.5.1]` (L13) |

### Key Link Verification

| From | To | Via | Status | Details |
|------|----|-----|--------|---------|
| `scripts/verify-per-group-claude-config.sh` | `agent-deck session send/output` | bash subprocess | PASSED (override) | Script uses `/proc/<pane_pid>/environ` instead — approved deviation. session start/stop/show/remove ARE present; the assertion method is different but tighter. Override: accepted by ashesh-goplani on 2026-04-15T20:18:10Z |
| `scripts/verify-per-group-claude-config.sh` | `~/.agent-deck/config.toml` | backup-restore via trap EXIT INT TERM | VERIFIED | `trap cleanup EXIT INT TERM` at line 107; `cp "$BACKUP_FILE" "$CONFIG_FILE"` in cleanup function; `trash "$BACKUP_FILE"` for temp files |
| `README.md` | `scripts/verify-per-group-claude-config.sh` | markdown reference in subsection body | VERIFIED | `grep -q 'scripts/verify-per-group-claude-config.sh' README.md` exits 0 |
| `CLAUDE.md` | `internal/session/pergroupconfig_test.go` | one-line reference to TestPerGroupConfig_* suite | VERIFIED | `grep -c "TestPerGroupConfig_" CLAUDE.md` = 1; backtick-wrapped suite name at line 50 |
| `CHANGELOG.md` | `github.com/asheshgoplani/agent-deck/pull/578` | PR #578 link appended to Added bullet | VERIFIED | `grep -q 'github.com/asheshgoplani/agent-deck/pull/578' CHANGELOG.md` exits 0 |
| `git log main..HEAD` | `@alec-pinson` | at least one commit body carries attribution | VERIFIED | 16 commits carry `@alec-pinson` via `git log --grep` |

### Data-Flow Trace (Level 4)

Not applicable — this phase produces bash scripts and documentation, not components that render dynamic data.

### Behavioral Spot-Checks

| Behavior | Command | Result | Status |
|----------|---------|--------|--------|
| Harness script exits 0 on conductor host | `bash scripts/verify-per-group-claude-config.sh` (captured to artifact log) | `PASS: 2/2`, exit 0 | PASS |
| Harness syntax valid | `bash -n scripts/verify-per-group-claude-config.sh` | exit 0 | PASS |
| README subsection count | `grep -c "^### Per-group Claude config$" README.md` | 1 | PASS |
| CLAUDE.md tracked | `git ls-files --error-unmatch CLAUDE.md` | exit 0 | PASS |
| TestPerGroupConfig_ occurrence count | `grep -c "TestPerGroupConfig_" CLAUDE.md` | 1 | PASS |
| CHANGELOG bullet in Unreleased | awk window check | bullet found between `## [Unreleased]` and `## [1.5.1]` | PASS |

### Requirements Coverage

| Requirement | Source Plan | Description | Status | Evidence |
|-------------|-------------|-------------|--------|----------|
| CFG-05 | 03-01-PLAN.md | Visual harness `scripts/verify-per-group-claude-config.sh` — creates two throwaway groups, launches normal + custom-command session, asserts CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR, prints pass/fail table, exits 0 | SATISFIED | Script exists at 256 lines, runs and exits 0 with PASS: 2/2; artifact log at `artifacts/harness-run-20260415T201810Z.log` |
| CFG-06 | 03-02-PLAN.md | Three doc surfaces + attribution: README subsection, CLAUDE.md one-liner, CHANGELOG bullet, at least one commit with @alec-pinson attribution | SATISFIED | All three doc surfaces verified; 16 commits with @alec-pinson attribution on main..HEAD |

### Anti-Patterns Found

| File | Line | Pattern | Severity | Impact |
|------|------|---------|----------|--------|
| `scripts/verify-per-group-claude-config.sh` | 149-178 | `poll_output` function defined but never called (dead code) | Warning | Does not affect runtime correctness — harness uses `get_pane_env` (defined inline in `main()`) and succeeded with PASS: 2/2. Noted in 03-REVIEW.md WR-03. |
| `scripts/verify-per-group-claude-config.sh` | 66-74 | Preflight checks `agent-deck`, `tmux`, `trash`, `$CONFIG_FILE` but not `awk` or bash version | Warning | Script uses `awk` for timing math. awk is ubiquitous; harness ran successfully. Noted in 03-REVIEW.md WR-01. |
| `scripts/verify-per-group-claude-config.sh` | 201-213 | `get_pane_env` reads `/proc/$pane_pid/environ` once after fixed `CAPTURE_DELAY=2.5s` — not polled | Warning | Single-shot read. Runtime validated at PASS: 2/2. Race possible on very slow startups. Noted in 03-REVIEW.md WR-02. |
| `CLAUDE.md` | 24, 36, 44 | References `scripts/verify-session-persistence.sh` which does not exist in this worktree | Info | Pre-existing factual drift, not introduced by Phase 3. Not blocking. Noted in 03-REVIEW.md IN-04. |

No blockers. All anti-patterns are warnings or informational items that do not prevent goal achievement. The harness passed runtime verification with PASS: 2/2 despite these shell-quality issues.

### Human Verification Required

#### 1. --no-verify usage on planning doc commit 911c0e7

**Test:** Inspect commit 911c0e7 (`docs(03-02): complete plan 02 — CFG-06 doc surfaces + hard-rule audit PASS`) and decide whether the `--no-verify` usage noted in the 03-02-SUMMARY self-check is acceptable.

**Expected:** The commit only touched `.planning/phases/03-visual-harness-documentation-attribution-commit/03-02-SUMMARY.md` — a pure markdown planning file. The lefthook `pre-commit` hook runs `gofmt -l .` and `go vet ./...`. Since no `.go` files were staged, both checks would have been no-ops and the hook would have passed anyway. The `--no-verify` bypass has zero functional impact on code quality.

**Why human:** STATE.md hard rule states "No --no-verify (v1.5.3 mandate)" with no exception for planning doc commits. Whether the intent of the mandate applies to commits touching only `.planning/*.md` files requires a judgment call. If acceptable, no action needed. If not, a follow-up commit can retroactively re-run the hook (the content is already correct).

#### 2. Code-review warnings WR-01, WR-02, WR-03 in 03-REVIEW.md

**Test:** Review the three shell-quality warnings in `03-REVIEW.md` and decide if any warrant a fix commit before closing the phase.

**Expected:** All three are non-blocking quality issues (missing awk preflight check, single-shot /proc read vs. polling, dead `poll_output` function). The harness ran successfully with PASS: 2/2 in `artifacts/harness-run-20260415T201810Z.log`. The fix for WR-02 (convert `get_pane_env` to poll like `poll_output`) would improve robustness on slow claude startups but is not required for the phase gate.

**Why human:** The 03-REVIEW.md documents these as advisory (non-blocking). Whether any should be must-haves depends on user tolerance for shell-script quality vs. shipping quickly. Automated verification cannot assess this risk tradeoff.

### Gaps Summary

No gaps found. All 12 must-have truths are either VERIFIED or PASSED (override). The phase goal is achieved:

- `scripts/verify-per-group-claude-config.sh` ships as a 256-line executable harness that proved CFG-05 on the conductor host with exit 0 and PASS: 2/2.
- All three doc surfaces (README subsection, CLAUDE.md one-liner, CHANGELOG bullet) are in place and correctly attributed.
- 16 commits on `main..HEAD` carry `@alec-pinson` attribution. All Ashesh-authored commits are signed. Zero Claude attribution in Ashesh-authored commits.
- No forbidden git operations (push/tag/PR/merge) were performed.

Two human verification items exist: one is a process question about a planning-doc commit that used `--no-verify` with no actual hook impact; the other is a quality decision about advisory shell-script warnings in the code review report. Neither represents a functional gap in the delivered phase output.
